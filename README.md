# Tab Saver

A Firefox extension for saving and restoring tab sessions

## Users

If it meets your needs, great! Otherwise, the extension is provided as-is with
no expecation of support, bug fixes, or new features. I will never monetize the
extension or collect user data.

## Developers

There is no build step. The extension is the src/ directory.

If you want to improve the extension, fork it. Feedback will be ignored and PRs
rejected.
